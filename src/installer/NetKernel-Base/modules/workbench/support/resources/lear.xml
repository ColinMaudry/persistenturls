<STAGEDIR>Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of</LINE>
<LINE>Albany than Cornwall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the</LINE>
<LINE>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of</LINE>
<LINE>the dukes he values most; for equalities are so</LINE>
<LINE>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice</LINE>
<LINE>of either's moiety.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this your son, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have</LINE>
<LINE>so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am</LINE>
<LINE>brazed to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot conceive you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon</LINE>
<LINE>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son</LINE>
<LINE>for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you smell a fault?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</LINE>
<LINE>being so proper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year</LINE>
<LINE>elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:</LINE>
<LINE>though this knave came something saucily into the</LINE>
<LINE>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother</LINE>
<LINE>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the</LINE>
<LINE>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this</LINE>
<LINE>noble gentleman, Edmund?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my</LINE>
<LINE>honourable friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My services to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall study deserving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall</LINE>
<LINE>again. The king is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</LINE>
<LINE>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent</LINE>
<LINE>To shake all cares and business from our age;</LINE>
<LINE>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</LINE>
<LINE>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</LINE>
<LINE>We have this hour a constant will to publish</LINE>
<LINE>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</LINE>
<LINE>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</LINE>
<LINE>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</LINE>
<LINE>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--</LINE>
<LINE>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</LINE>
<LINE>Interest of territory, cares of state,--</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</LINE>
<LINE>That we our largest bounty may extend</LINE>
<LINE>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</LINE>
<LINE>Our eldest-born, speak first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;</LINE>
<LINE>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</LINE>
<LINE>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</LINE>
<LINE>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</LINE>
<LINE>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  What shall Cordelia do?</LINE>
<LINE>Love, and be silent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</LINE>
<LINE>With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,</LINE>
<LINE>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</LINE>
<LINE>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue</LINE>
<LINE>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am made</LINE>
<LINE>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,</LINE>
<LINE>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</LINE>
<LINE>I find she names my very deed of love;</LINE>
<LINE>Only she comes too short: that I profess</LINE>
<LINE>Myself an enemy to all other joys,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;</LINE>
<LINE>And find I am alone felicitate</LINE>
<LINE>In your dear highness' love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt, with a dead march</STAGEDIR>
